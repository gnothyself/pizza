## This project served as an onboarding lesson for GitHub.
In this lesson, I learned out to create a local repo, upload those files to GitHub, and edit this README.md.<br>
I also learned how to reference code `like this`,
as well as create lists and format text, like this:
* *italic*
* **bold**
---
^ and that's a horizontal rule.<br>
<br>
This was fun.
